				___Notes For Recursion Trees___

1. Build everything within the Change folder

2. Within that folder make a ChangeCalculator class

3. Within the ChangeCalculator make a method call calculateChange(int)

4. The calculateChange method should _display_ and _return_ the total number of combinations of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that equal the desired amount and all of the combinations, avoiding duplications.

5. Use the best data structure you've learned so far

6. implement printCombinationToFIle(int): should contain a call to the recursive solution that you created

7. Create a CoinCombinations.txt: this method will write each combination produced to separate lines. This file will be read by the tester class to verify that your recursive solution avoids duplicate values.


NOTE: should dispense the highest coin first
