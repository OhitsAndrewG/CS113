(IN WORDS) WRITE ALGORITHMS FOR EACH ARRAYLISTSTACK METHOD USING THE ARRAYLIST<E>THEDATA:

//Note: returns true if the stack is empty otherwise, return false
Public Boolean Empty(){
	return true if top of stack is equal to -1
}

//Note: Peek method return the object at the top of the stack without removing it
public E peek(){
	if the stack is empty
		throw emptyStackException
	return the first index of the array
{

//Note:Pop method returns the object at the top of the stack an removes it
Public E pop(){
	if the stack is empty
		throw a new EmptyStackException
	return the item on top of the stack then makes the stack one item smaller
}

//Note: Push method pushes and item onto eh top of the stack and returns the item pushed
public E push(){
	add to size
	make the top of the stack index equal to the new object being put into the stack, to add to 
	the top of the stack
	return the obj that was inserted
}


USE ALL THEREE STACKS ABOVE FOR THE QUESTION BELOW:(lifo)

1.) For all three stack it would perform the same behavior and result, which is adding the two names to the stack, then removing one and leaving the first name that was added to the stack

Stack (A)	_Initial_	_Final_		
		Jonathon		Jane		top = Joseph
		Dustin		Jonathon		nextTop = Jane
		robin 		Dustin
		Debbie		robin
		rich		Debbie
				rich
2.) This would print out all the names within the stack, as well as clear the stack one at a time as it loops

3.) when using peek method, you wouldn't be clearing the stack while iterating through it
