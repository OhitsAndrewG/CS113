1.) 
Creates new set s
Adds two objects to s Set
addAll does nothing since you can't add the same data to a set
Creates another set (t)
Adds an object to set(t)
Adds all of set(t) to set(s)
Prints out true for the first statement and false for the second
Prints out false since the set does not contain that object
Prints out true since that object does exist in set(s)
This should change set(t) to the objects that both set(s) and (t) contain
The last line should print true


1.) 
	A. 
	Problem: C = (a U b)(Union)
	c.a.addAll(b)
	
	
	
	B.
	problem: c = (a n b)(intersection)
	c.a.retainAll(b)

	C.
	problem: c = (a - b)
	c.remove(b)
	
	D.
	b.containsAll(a)(subset)
2.
toString is already implemented, but you could actually...
Use string builder to create a full string to return. You would have to use an iterator to add all the strings together.
