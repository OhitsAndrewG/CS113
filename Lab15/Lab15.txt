_Lab 15_

1. Make an array that stores a linked list named "vertex"
2. You then would create multiple LinkedList calling them "vertex0, vertex1 ..."
3. You would then use the linked list add method to Create new nodes to the vertex(LinkedList)s you created, which are going to be the other (nodes/Vertex's) that the connect to the vertex you're adding it too.
4. This would create a graph and you'll be left with this;

	  
	0: 1, 4
	1: 0, 4, 3, 4
	2: 1, 3
	3: 4, 1, 2
	4: 0, 1, 3

Method: Adjacency List Method
