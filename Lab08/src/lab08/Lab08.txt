Queue - Fifo
Stack - Lifo

1.) when using the elements in a Queue using just the Queue operations, you would have to clear the queue as you print each element in the Queue out on the console


2.)
-creates string item
-while loop that checks whether the stack is empty
	-make the item variable equal to the item on top of the stack then removing it from stack s
	-adds the item that was popped (item) and adds it to the Queue (q)
	
-while loop that checks if the the Queue (q) is empty
	-makes the variable (item) equal to the first item first item that was put into the queue
	-then it gets that item and pushes it into the stack (s)
	
a.) After the first loop executes, nothing is stored in the stack and all of the items that were in the stack are now in the queue. 
b.)After the second loop, all items that were in the queue are now back in the stack.
