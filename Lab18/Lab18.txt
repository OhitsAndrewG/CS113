Answer: I believe the best option for this array of data would be the insertion sort, mainly because  its the worst case for both bubble sort and selection sort. For bubble sort, the data need to somewhat organized in order for it to work well, which in this case it isn't. For selection sort the last two digits are the smallest ones, so it would make the runtime a lot slower, if the data set was larger. I believe that selection sort is the best case for this.
